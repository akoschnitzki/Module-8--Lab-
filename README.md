# Module-8--Lab-




Hello World,

Alex here, in this module I was able to show the answer to the questions. In each of the 
questions, I was able to use the function method for each of them so that they can be able to run
the best way. In each of the questions, you can be able to input different numbers and the program 
can still be able to run.

From Alex
